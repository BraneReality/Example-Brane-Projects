# CES Demo 2025

This is a cleaned up version of what I showed off at the 2025 XR Experience event. 

This was run with commit `08f1cb39ff312f1c0a88d3115f8c633651316076` on the ces/demo branch, to test the project with that branch 
you'll need to look at the diff of that commit and swap out the hardcoded IP addresses I threw in for your own, specifically whatever computer you're hosing the asset server on, or localhost if just testing locally. 

Model used is the [damaged helmet](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets/tree/main/Models/DamagedHelmet) from the gltf sample assets repo
